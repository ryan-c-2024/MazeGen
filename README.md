# MazeGen
Java maze generator

MazeGen is a maze generator written in Java. It utilizes the UnionFind algorithm and the disjoint-set data structure to generate CLI mazes that fit given specifications. 
- One specification is that there is one given exit and entrance
- The other is that there are no completely enclosed squares and that there is a given path such that one can get from the entrance to exit

I expect this maze generation format to be useful in the context of video games and similar applications.
